# Data-Cleaning-and-Exploration-using-GCP

# Overview
This project focuses on data acquisition, profiling, cleaning, and visualization using various tools and platforms.

# Data Source
The data was sourced from Kaggle, a platform that hosts datasets for analysis.

# Process
1. Data Profiling
Initial profiling was conducted to understand the structure and quality of the data.
2. Data Cleaning
Data cleaning was performed using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Data Prep to ensure accuracy and consistency.
3. Data Storage and Analysis
Cleaned data was loaded into BigQuery to derive insights through queries and analysis.
4. Data Visualization
Insights were visualized using Tableau, which facilitated a deeper understanding of the data.
Additional data preparation and cleaning were carried out using Tableau Prep.
